[0.00s -> 5.72s]  Well, I'm not an expert. I'm not an authority. I'm someone who has been a murderer for almost 20 years
[5.86s -> 10.88s]  Can you say how many people might be doing crimes like you were doing?
[10.88s -> 14.12s]  It would be a guess, but it's not it's far more than 35
[14.62s -> 21.38s]  It isn't that impossible in this society. It happens, but there are more people. They didn't give up
[22.56s -> 27.72s]  How many she didn't give up. I did I came in out of the cold
[28.72s -> 31.20s]  And what I'm saying is there are some people who
[31.80s -> 33.80s]  Prefer it in the cold. Good people see
[34.32s -> 36.32s]  a nice guy
[36.32s -> 40.92s]  Did you like Kemper? I like Kemper. You were able to appear like a
[41.76s -> 47.08s]  Ordinary person non-threatening to I lived as an ordinary person most of my life
[47.40s -> 51.44s]  Even though I was living a parallel and increasingly sick life
[51.92s -> 56.12s]  Other life one victim let me back in the car. I locked myself out
[57.12s -> 59.12s]  She opened the door for me
[59.88s -> 61.88s]  My gun was under the seat
[62.28s -> 64.28s]  What in the hell am I doing telling you that?
[64.72s -> 68.28s]  Am I looking am I am a masochist am I looking to be tormented further?
[68.92s -> 70.92s]  I'm trying to show you just how
[72.64s -> 78.32s]  Awful this got how commanding these rages got I was raging inside. There was just
[80.44s -> 83.60s]  Incredible energies positive and negative
[83.60s -> 89.32s]  Depending on a mood that would trigger one or the other and
[90.48s -> 94.64s]  Outside I looked troubled at times other times. I looked moody
[95.68s -> 97.76s]  other times perfectly serene
[99.08s -> 101.92s]  Not very sane, but again
[103.32s -> 111.08s]  People weren't even aware of what was happening in 1972 and 1973 a series of murders shocked northern, California
[112.08s -> 115.28s]  College girls began to disappear while hitchhiking
[116.28s -> 121.04s]  Two of the victims were picked up from the campus of the University of California at Santa Cruz
[122.00s -> 126.00s]  That's where Ed Kemper's mother was working as an administrative assistant
[126.80s -> 130.20s]  You were involved in a campus because your mother worked there. Yes
[131.92s -> 138.00s]  I was also involved in killing coeds because my mother was associated with college work college coeds
[138.88s -> 140.88s]  women and
[141.08s -> 144.56s]  Had had very strong and violently outspoken
[145.40s -> 147.20s]  position on men
[147.20s -> 151.52s]  For much of my upbringing. My mother was sick angry
[152.16s -> 153.92s]  hungry
[153.92s -> 156.40s]  And very sad woman. I hated her
[157.08s -> 163.84s]  But I wanted to love my mother and I watched the alcohol increase. I watched her social life drop off
[163.84s -> 168.76s]  I watched her get bizarre. She had terrible pain from her life
[169.48s -> 171.48s]  Earlier life her upbringing a
[172.04s -> 178.08s]  Failed marriage with my father. I'm a constant reminder of that failure. I hate to distill it down into such
[179.60s -> 184.80s]  In the one word realities like that. There's a lot that leads into that happening, but that is what happened
[185.44s -> 191.44s]  They represented not what my mother was but what she liked what she coveted what was important to her
[191.60s -> 194.96s]  And I was destroying it. Why did you actually kill the girls?
[195.72s -> 200.64s]  My frustration my inability to communicate
[202.48s -> 205.78s]  Socially sexually I wasn't impotent
[206.76s -> 213.52s]  But emotionally I was impotent. I was scared to death of failing in male-female relationships
[213.52s -> 215.88s]  I knew absolutely nothing about that whole area
[216.56s -> 219.36s]  Even if just sitting down and talking with the young lady. I
[220.36s -> 223.44s]  Need to be able to really communicate and ironically enough
[223.44s -> 229.76s]  That's why I began picking people up and I'm picking up young women and I'm going a little bit farther each time
[229.76s -> 231.76s]  It's a daring kind of a thing
[232.48s -> 236.88s]  At first there wasn't a gun. I'm driving along. We'd go to a vulnerable place
[237.56s -> 244.20s]  But there aren't people watching where I could act out and I say no I can't and then a gun is in the car
[244.68s -> 246.68s]  hidden and this
[247.60s -> 250.12s]  Craving this awful raging eating
[251.28s -> 258.76s]  Feeling inside I could feel it consuming my insides this fantastic passion
[261.68s -> 263.68s]  It was overwhelming me
[263.80s -> 270.40s]  It was like drugs. It was like alcohol a little isn't enough at first it is and as you adjust to that
[270.88s -> 274.30s]  Psychologically and physically you take more and more and more. It's the same process
[274.66s -> 278.90s]  So it finally came down to the thing of do I dare bring this gun out?
[279.54s -> 282.66s]  Already realizing if that gun comes out something has to happen
[283.22s -> 287.06s]  It was going to happen. I didn't see it then, but it was going to happen
[287.06s -> 289.06s]  I was playing a dangerous game with a loaded gun
[289.50s -> 291.50s]  It got us all on
[291.70s -> 295.10s]  One occasion Kemper picked up two roommates in Berkeley
[299.82s -> 302.98s]  And that first killing in May of 72
[303.74s -> 308.62s]  When that gun was pulled out I launched it out for it. I had it under my leg out of sight
[309.70s -> 311.70s]  Parallel to my to my leg in the seat
[312.18s -> 316.78s]  It was something that had been thought out in fantasy acted out felt out
[317.98s -> 319.54s]  hundreds of times
[319.54s -> 321.54s]  before it ever happened
[321.54s -> 324.98s]  Kemper drove them at gunpoint to a secluded area near a park
[325.54s -> 329.78s]  He took one of them into the woods leaving the second girl tied in the car. I
[330.50s -> 333.98s]  Just gone through a horrible experience with her roommate stabbing her
[334.82s -> 340.26s]  And I was in shock because of that. I couldn't believe that it was that way and I'm walking back there bewildered
[340.26s -> 342.66s]  I got a killer. I can't let her go. She's gonna tell him
[344.30s -> 346.30s]  Everybody's gonna get
[350.34s -> 354.54s]  She sees the blood on my hands, what are you doing? She pulled back and she gasped
[355.70s -> 359.38s]  And I think whoa, I don't want her to know what happened
[359.78s -> 361.30s]  I
[361.30s -> 365.42s]  Said your friend got smart with me. She'd been getting really smart with me a lot, but I never hit her
[365.42s -> 370.46s]  I killed her, but I didn't hit her. I said your friend got smart with me, and I hit her
[370.46s -> 375.46s]  I think I broke her nose. You better come help. She's about to die. Why don't why does she have to know that? I
[377.38s -> 379.38s]  Couldn't deal with telling her that
[380.42s -> 383.38s]  When I attacked her she didn't at first realize what was happening
[383.38s -> 387.66s]  It didn't go through very heavy coveralls on it knocked her right up into the lid of the car
[388.06s -> 390.06s]  But it didn't pierce the clothing
[391.18s -> 393.18s]  Wasn't that swell a knife anyway
[393.70s -> 395.86s]  I went out and bought a pawn shop
[396.38s -> 397.70s]  huge
[397.70s -> 399.70s]  knife and
[400.02s -> 402.02s]  I
[402.02s -> 406.26s]  Kept on it just mindlessly attacking. She falls back into the trunk. I
[408.22s -> 412.94s]  Just killed a young woman. I slammed down the lid of the trunk. She isn't dead. She's dying
[413.78s -> 419.66s]  And I panicked I thought I just locked the car keys because I can't find them in my pocket. Oh
[420.02s -> 424.54s]  My god, I locked them in the trunk. I'm kicking on the trunk lid and yanking on it. Oh
[425.22s -> 431.18s]  No, I don't believe this I started to run and I tripped over the gun that I'd had in my pants that I had totally forgotten
[431.18s -> 435.42s]  Was there I stopped I said stop and think I collected my wits
[436.06s -> 441.34s]  Check all your pockets. I picked the gun up. I stuck it back in my pants now remembering I had one I
[442.34s -> 445.54s]  Checked all my pockets and there's the keys in the back pocket
[445.54s -> 449.10s]  I never put them in my back pocket everyone makes mistakes and that's
[449.62s -> 453.78s]  What we have to hope for more mistakes. They make the better and better their chances
[453.78s -> 455.78s]  I thought I was pretty slick and
[456.46s -> 461.58s]  Women stripped all over myself that first two murders the first 24 hours
[461.58s -> 468.94s]  There were three clear times I should have been busted and I wasn't because three different individuals or three different groups of people
[469.70s -> 471.70s]  got scared and
[471.86s -> 476.86s]  Minded their own business and looked the other way some of the people who are committing
[477.46s -> 482.18s]  Murders even as we speak if they're doing it by themselves and they tell no one about it
[482.34s -> 488.58s]  They could go on undetected until they decided to stop and the police wouldn't catch them unless we just happened to roll up on them
[488.58s -> 490.22s]  while they were doing it
[490.22s -> 495.72s]  Even after police warnings against hitchhiking and an increased bus schedule on the campus
[496.40s -> 498.72s]  Kemper had no trouble picking up hitchhikers
[499.96s -> 504.60s]  Ironically one warning advised riding only in cars with university stickers
[505.80s -> 507.80s]  Kemper's car had such a sticker
[508.16s -> 514.00s]  My mother worked at the campus and I had an ace sticker on my car and obvious access day or night to the campus
[514.00s -> 516.00s]  I was picking up some very lovely young women
[516.76s -> 521.00s]  You know what we were talking about as we're driving around almost as often as not
[521.44s -> 526.84s]  This guy that's going around doing this stuff and the second they started talking that they didn't realize it
[526.84s -> 528.84s]  But they were getting a free ride. I
[528.96s -> 532.40s]  Couldn't touch that with a 10-foot pole. I swear, you know
[532.48s -> 536.08s]  But they'd be telling me what all about this guy and they're comparing notes and
[536.48s -> 540.12s]  Speculating on what he looks like how he carries himself. Why he's doing this stuff
[540.92s -> 542.92s]  telling me about it
[543.56s -> 548.60s]  So how come they get in a car with somebody at that time she judged me not to be that guy I
[549.60s -> 551.60s]  Didn't look like it
[552.80s -> 558.00s]  It's getting easier to do I was getting better at it. I was getting less detectable. I started
[558.76s -> 560.76s]  flaunting that invisibility
[561.80s -> 568.28s]  Severing a human head two of them at night in front of my mother's residence with her at home my neighbors at home upstairs
[568.56s -> 575.00s]  Their picture window open the curtains open 11 o'clock at night the lights are on all they have to do is walk by and look out
[575.00s -> 576.24s]  And I've had it
[576.24s -> 581.64s]  Why did you keep the heads where'd you cut them off? And why did you keep something out of my childhood?
[582.96s -> 584.96s]  I
[585.12s -> 591.88s]  Could put it on an incident. I mean my father chopping the heads off of our two-pet chickens and my mother insisting that I eat them for
[591.88s -> 593.88s]  dinner
[594.28s -> 597.96s]  You know that we could say it was something that simple. I don't think it was
[598.44s -> 600.94s]  Now my dad heads out back with a hatchet. I
[601.60s -> 604.76s]  Got on my bike and I wrote right to try to stop it. I remember that
[604.76s -> 606.76s]  I got on the bike road around the block
[607.52s -> 609.00s]  I was crying
[609.00s -> 616.08s]  Haven't talked about that for a lot of years. I'm sure that may have implemented something that may have gotten something rolling
[616.08s -> 621.56s]  But along fantasy lines, but it took a lot of years of development along those lines to really get off
[621.76s -> 628.80s]  but how are you able to in one minute have someone's head in your hands and
[629.48s -> 631.80s]  Very shortly they're having through a fantasy
[632.56s -> 637.44s]  However, that would relate to that severed head and then five minutes later
[637.44s -> 641.80s]  I'd put that away and there'd be a knock on the door and I'd put it away
[642.32s -> 648.56s]  And answer the door and the landlady would be there and we discuss it discuss what reality
[649.56s -> 651.08s]  Her reality
[651.08s -> 656.28s]  Not mine. Some people go crazy at that point. I felt it. It was one hell of a tweak
[656.28s -> 658.72s]  I mean to just flip out and not know where I was
[659.68s -> 662.52s]  To be walking up the stairs with a camera bag
[663.16s -> 666.88s]  That belonged to a young woman that had her severed head in it
[669.28s -> 673.24s]  Walking up to my apartment past a happy young couple coming down the stairs
[673.76s -> 675.76s]  Who nodded and smiled at me?
[676.32s -> 678.56s]  As they went by good evening
[679.36s -> 685.20s]  And they're going out on a date where I'd love to be going and I'm aware of both of these realities and the
[685.76s -> 689.72s]  Distance between those two is so dramatic so amazing so violent
[691.20s -> 696.20s]  That that really I could feel the wheel squeaking inside that was really pulling on it
[696.20s -> 701.72s]  And I imagine at that point some people break, but I didn't literally go insane. I didn't get lost
[702.64s -> 704.48s]  And all this time
[704.48s -> 706.48s]  Kemper was able to seem normal
[706.80s -> 713.76s]  He even hung out at a bar across the street from the courthouse making friends with policemen trying to pick up information
[714.36s -> 716.52s]  They'd buy me a beer. I'd buy them a beer
[717.48s -> 722.24s]  Casual relationships, but that was I was poking around a little bit trying to find some things out
[722.24s -> 724.80s]  I knew they wouldn't be privy to hot information
[724.80s -> 729.32s]  But there were some things that were bothering me like were there any speculations on how they were dying
[729.76s -> 731.76s]  Did the cops like you?
[733.40s -> 736.16s]  Like I said a friendly nuisance I got in the way
[737.16s -> 739.16s]  And it was deliberate
[739.16s -> 741.36s]  Again friendly nuisances are dismissed
[741.76s -> 747.76s]  How did you get the knowledge to outsmart the police watching television believe it or not
[748.88s -> 753.16s]  Joseph Wambaugh police story got some tremendous insights into not just
[753.48s -> 757.56s]  The gimmicks the actual things the tidbits that you would pick up from their procedures
[758.00s -> 765.32s]  But the mechanics behind that the logic behind it was I would not allow myself to walk into even a potential trap of
[766.24s -> 767.92s]  behavior and
[767.92s -> 770.72s]  One of those was talking about those crimes too much
[771.40s -> 774.62s]  To people initiating conversations about that
[775.20s -> 778.44s]  There was a memorial service for two of the victims
[780.04s -> 782.04s]  Will you attempt to go yes?
[782.48s -> 784.48s]  but I'd
[784.88s -> 790.88s]  Seen one too many episodes of one too many crime shows where that is one of the available resources for clues
[792.48s -> 798.56s]  Tracking down the attenders take one man taking pictures of the people there to eliminate as potential suspects
[799.04s -> 807.52s]  Some police department now. They actually came to your house to pick up a handgun sheriff's representatives one of their detectives was
[808.56s -> 813.92s]  Upset because he heard I had a 44 Magnum pistol and was a convicted man
[813.92s -> 817.60s]  He came to take the gun away and it was on a he and a sergeant detective
[818.36s -> 821.12s]  They were staking out the wrong house. It was across the street
[821.12s -> 826.56s]  And I'm playing around with a car standing next to the gun in the trunk. They come over and asked me about
[827.28s -> 829.28s]  Excuse me, sir
[829.64s -> 834.20s]  Do you know who lives in this house across the street here? Well that house was 609 Harriet
[834.72s -> 840.44s]  He crossed back over to this side in the 609 ord, and they were looking for me and didn't even know that
[840.84s -> 842.04s]  So I mean
[842.04s -> 844.88s]  Bad news. Well any rate we walk into the house
[844.92s -> 851.36s]  They have them ask my mother about this other house, and I'm saying hey, which 609 are you looking for and they said are you at
[851.60s -> 853.60s]  yes, and it goes on and
[854.52s -> 855.80s]  I
[855.80s -> 861.44s]  Needed to find out what they were looking for the murder weapon the 22 automatic or the 44 Magnum
[861.44s -> 863.84s]  And I don't want to advertise that I've got a whole bunch of guns
[867.40s -> 871.08s]  So I made a comment just to divine between the two and
[872.28s -> 877.24s]  I suggest quite a little gun isn't it and he retorted 44 Magnum. I hope so
[878.24s -> 884.80s]  And it's okay because that loaded 22 was under the front seat and guaranteed me an arrest right on the spot and
[886.64s -> 888.64s]  44 was in the trunk. I
[889.44s -> 892.56s]  Forgot that I took them in the house. We went into my bedroom and
[893.92s -> 899.44s]  Closet doors open and I have a high-powered rifle with a scope on it. You had some other stuff in the house, too
[899.44s -> 900.40s]  Yes
[900.40s -> 907.20s]  Yeah, I had the personal effects and identification of the last two coeds that have been murdered about two months
[907.20s -> 908.32s]  before
[908.32s -> 911.40s]  Right next to the guns in the closet in a box
[912.76s -> 913.88s]  Could he have seen it?
[913.88s -> 919.08s]  No, but when he arrested me for having all those guns and went through the rest of the closet looking to see if there were any
[919.08s -> 924.32s]  Pistols or anything else. He wouldn't have couldn't have helped notice a purse a book bag and
[924.80s -> 931.16s]  Coed ID inside of those belonging to their two latest murder victims. I'd back up. I said, oh, excuse me
[931.16s -> 935.56s]  I just remembered so and instantly he responds to what I'm saying my hand moves
[936.08s -> 940.04s]  Back we go outside and you still think a boy. This is a really nice and helpful guy here
[940.48s -> 945.44s]  Some of these people are doing what you and I do to become better killers. They practice their trade
[946.16s -> 947.68s]  Kemper stopped himself
[947.68s -> 953.68s]  To the end of his career. Kemper says he did he says he could have gone on. He said he had fantasies of killing
[954.92s -> 960.88s]  Dozens more people of leaving a trail of bodies across the country and at one point he just got on the telephone and turned himself in
[960.88s -> 964.38s]  He said it was time for the killing to stop in his case. He said
[965.06s -> 970.22s]  Publicly that it was his mother that he was killing all along and when he killed his mother that was the end
[970.38s -> 974.42s]  It's a very deep psychological observation from himself. It may be very accurate
[975.30s -> 977.02s]  It was spring time
[977.02s -> 979.02s]  It was April
[980.38s -> 984.58s]  For two months I hadn't killed and I said it's not going to happen any more girls
[985.70s -> 990.42s]  It's got to stay between me and my mother and it's got a I can't get away from her
[990.90s -> 996.06s]  We're still fighting. She's still belittling me. She's still I'm like a puppet on a string and I entertain her
[996.06s -> 1001.50s]  She knows all my buttons and I dance like a puppet with that pain and it even got physical
[1003.14s -> 1005.14s]  To where I had physically
[1005.42s -> 1010.98s]  Grabbed her and thrown her onto her bed trying to emphasize a point that she's threatening to kill her
[1011.86s -> 1015.70s]  So here I pick up these two young ladies in Berkeley on Ashby Avenue
[1016.50s -> 1019.34s]  One has flowers in her hand to teat little dolls
[1019.74s -> 1025.02s]  They're in granny dresses and they're hitchhiking a couple of real experts. I want to see how together
[1025.02s -> 1027.42s]  I am if I can resist this temptation
[1029.10s -> 1031.10s]  You're going to Walnut Creek
[1036.58s -> 1038.18s]  And they get in my car
[1038.18s -> 1039.46s]  They want to go one way
[1039.46s -> 1044.42s]  I know they need to go the other if they go the way they're insisting on we're headed right back out to where
[1044.42s -> 1051.70s]  The first two coeds were murdered and I'm saying to myself. Oh my god. All I got to do is relax and they'll take me to their death
[1052.46s -> 1056.08s]  I've got the gun in the car the same one. I've been doing it way. I
[1057.06s -> 1062.22s]  Insisted as gently as I could I took them where they needed to go to their college
[1062.22s -> 1078.58s]  That was one week before I murdered my mother. I said she's got to die and I've got to die or girls like that are gonna die
[1079.42s -> 1082.26s]  And that's when I decided I'm going to murder my mother. I
[1082.86s -> 1087.62s]  Knew a week before she died. I was gonna kill her and she went out to a party. She got sourced
[1087.62s -> 1092.50s]  She came home went to sleep. I was woken up by that. I got came out. I
[1093.26s -> 1095.26s]  Walked up to her bed
[1095.26s -> 1097.26s]  She's laying there reading a paperback
[1098.50s -> 1100.50s]  As many thousands of nights before
[1102.38s -> 1103.78s]  And
[1103.78s -> 1107.98s]  She said oh, I suppose you're gonna want to sit up all night and talk now
[1110.70s -> 1114.42s]  Shit I looked at her I said no. I said goodnight
[1118.62s -> 1121.34s]  Yeah, and I knew us gonna kill her
[1122.26s -> 1124.26s]  you know and
[1124.26s -> 1126.26s]  I'm so cold is so hard
[1127.02s -> 1133.38s]  And that's the first time in 10 years. I've looked at it that way. I mean that intensely that honestly
[1134.30s -> 1136.30s]  their hearts
[1137.06s -> 1140.98s]  Because I'm not a lizard. I'm not from under a rock. I came out her vagina
[1142.10s -> 1143.38s]  See
[1143.38s -> 1145.38s]  came out of my mother and
[1145.82s -> 1147.82s]  In a rage I went right back in
[1148.86s -> 1156.62s]  For seven years. She said I haven't had sex with a man because of you my murderous son is one of our arguments I
[1158.22s -> 1160.22s]  Cut off her head
[1160.90s -> 1163.46s]  And I humiliated her corpse
[1164.30s -> 1166.30s]  It's a dare
[1166.30s -> 1168.30s]  you know
[1168.34s -> 1174.98s]  Six young woman dead because of the way she raises her son and the way her son is raised the way he grows up
[1175.74s -> 1180.34s]  And what's her closing words? I suppose you want to sit up all night and talk
[1181.90s -> 1183.90s]  God I don't I wish I had
[1187.26s -> 1189.26s]  Hmm
[1189.26s -> 1196.50s]  Your grandmother and her daughter-in-law your mother were two women very important in your life and
[1196.94s -> 1198.58s]  You killed them both
[1198.58s -> 1204.66s]  Could you say what they were like that led them to the same fate?
[1205.38s -> 1208.90s]  Same thing that kept them from ever being friends. They're both aggressive
[1211.98s -> 1216.78s]  Matriarchal women they'd been the daughters of strong matriarchal women
[1216.78s -> 1221.54s]  I still loved my mother and it's hard for somebody to comprehend that you murder your mother through love
[1221.98s -> 1226.52s]  It isn't a rational process. It's a very painful process. It isn't rational
[1227.42s -> 1231.18s]  And I've got to still live with that. Why did you wind up giving yourself up?
[1231.18s -> 1234.54s]  It had to stop
[1236.22s -> 1241.14s]  It had to stop once my mother was dead there's almost a cathartic process at that point
[1241.14s -> 1243.14s]  I got physically ill right then
[1243.26s -> 1248.50s]  When she died when I murdered her and once she was dead, there was no way I could back out
[1248.50s -> 1251.82s]  I had backed it down from giving up a thousand times
[1253.30s -> 1258.82s]  You know I used to get drunk and go sit out in front of the sheriff's department in a parking lot across the street
[1259.02s -> 1262.30s]  On one of those little concrete parking berms, and I just sit there and say
[1262.86s -> 1264.86s]  I still can't
[1264.86s -> 1267.14s]  The clanging doors I could still hear them
[1267.82s -> 1269.82s]  No, because it'll never open again
[1271.94s -> 1273.94s]  You know so I I
[1274.90s -> 1278.22s]  Rationalized that to give up would be insane to give up would be crazy
[1279.46s -> 1281.98s]  I'd be giving away my freedom and I don't need to
[1283.02s -> 1288.42s]  But I look back on that and wish I had earlier when I was saying those things to myself
[1288.90s -> 1293.10s]  The people who were later dead wouldn't be the regret that came later
[1293.78s -> 1295.78s]  Would have not had to be
[1297.50s -> 1302.74s]  Those people not things those people would still be with their families with their loved ones
[1303.42s -> 1305.42s]  They would have their own families
[1305.62s -> 1308.70s]  If I had had the courage to make that decision
[1310.10s -> 1312.10s]  Instead of painting myself into the corner
[1312.46s -> 1317.66s]  Where might you be if you'd never given in to the impulse to murder where might I be?
[1319.30s -> 1321.30s]  If my parole had been successful
[1322.42s -> 1323.86s]  I
[1323.86s -> 1328.26s]  Believe I'd be married and have children. I'd be heading toward my first grandchildren
