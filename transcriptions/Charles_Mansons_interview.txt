[0.00s -> 8.00s]  Manson has been serving his time at this prison in Vacaville, California, isolated from his fellow inmates.
[8.00s -> 13.00s]  Manson's first television interview since the murders begins badly.
[13.00s -> 18.00s]  No, I told you I'm not going to sit in that damn chair, man. I'll stand here and talk with the dude.
[18.00s -> 24.00s]  Manson refuses to sit in the chair provided. He says he's not going to look up to anyone.
[24.00s -> 29.00s]  But finally, Tom Snyder of the National Broadcasting Company asks his first question.
[29.00s -> 32.98s]  You know, you were sentenced to the gas chamber, and then they modified the death penalty.
[33.10s -> 34.54s]  Were you happy when that was done?
[35.80s -> 37.46s]  Was I happy when what was done?
[37.50s -> 39.58s]  When you found out that you weren't going to the gas chamber.
[40.08s -> 41.36s]  You're talking about dying.
[42.40s -> 43.58s]  Now, it gets me nervous.
[43.82s -> 44.14s]  Why?
[44.46s -> 46.02s]  Did you have any thoughts about something?
[47.14s -> 48.26s]  Was you wanting to go anywhere?
[52.26s -> 55.44s]  Were you happy when you found out you weren't going to go to the gas chamber, Charles?
[55.44s -> 60.10s]  I knew I wasn't going to go to the gas chamber because I hadn't done anything wrong.
[63.44s -> 64.60s]  You scared to die?
[67.86s -> 70.10s]  Sometimes I feel I'm scared to live.
[70.98s -> 72.54s]  Living is what scares me.
[73.14s -> 74.58s]  Dying is easy.
[75.46s -> 77.72s]  How long have I been in jail? 34 years?
[78.54s -> 80.56s]  34 years, so...
[80.56s -> 82.22s]  Out of 47, you've been here 34.
[82.22s -> 83.34s]  I've been in jail.
[84.60s -> 85.12s]  Prison.
[85.44s -> 92.52s]  a long time, all my life. I was raised up in here. So I understand jail. So I understand myself and I
[92.52s -> 100.02s]  can deal with that. I set my cell and I do my number like a convict does his number. But there's
[100.02s -> 103.70s]  different colors on different people's backs doing different things. There's a different
[103.70s -> 108.88s]  world. I love the world I live in too, just like Regan loves the world he lives in. You love the
[108.88s -> 115.18s]  world you live in. Most assuredly, it's me. You love all the pain that you've caused people. All
[115.18s -> 117.40s]  Oh, I don't know pain.
[117.90s -> 118.72s]  I don't know pain.
[118.80s -> 120.08s]  I have no depth of pain.
[120.40s -> 121.88s]  I have no depth of suffering.
[122.26s -> 123.46s]  I don't know ridicule.
[123.84s -> 125.34s]  I don't know all the bad things.
[125.62s -> 128.86s]  I haven't been punished by you all my life since I was 10 years old.
[129.12s -> 131.44s]  I've been in every reform school you've got across the country
[131.44s -> 134.56s]  and used to lay down and have to get my ass whipped until I couldn't walk.
[135.22s -> 136.46s]  Tell me about some pain.
[136.46s -> 137.56s]  And that's our fault.
[137.68s -> 138.88s]  That's all those people want.
[138.88s -> 139.18s]  No fault.
[139.46s -> 140.78s]  Make strong good pain.
[140.88s -> 141.68s]  Understand pain.
[141.88s -> 142.42s]  Not bad.
[143.78s -> 144.60s]  Pain's not bad.
[144.60s -> 151.68s]  It's good. It teaches you things. It teaches you things. Like when you put your hand in fire,
[151.78s -> 155.54s]  oh, you know not to do that again. Yeah. Yeah, I understand that.
[155.70s -> 161.36s]  Written accounts indicate that you told the authorities, don't let me out. I can't cope
[161.36s -> 163.42s]  with the outside world. Do you have a recollection of that?
[163.76s -> 168.22s]  You make a desperate plea out of something, man. There's no desperate plea out of it.
[168.54s -> 171.62s]  I say I can't handle the maniacs outside. Let me back in.
[171.62s -> 174.18s]  I didn't use the word desperate. That's your word, Charles.
[174.18s -> 179.66s]  Yeah, well, your inflection and your voice tones were implications there.
[179.88s -> 184.68s]  Well, you used the word maniacs on the outside.
[185.32s -> 188.64s]  How are you different from the maniacs on the outside?
[188.80s -> 190.90s]  And why do you call them maniacs?
[190.90s -> 193.56s]  Because you know something, they think you are one.
[193.86s -> 195.30s]  Yeah, it would reflect.
[195.30s -> 200.94s]  If you hold the negative up to the light, you don't see the light, you just see the negative.
[201.66s -> 203.06s]  So I'm a reflection of your negative.
[203.16s -> 204.16s]  There's no doubt about that.
[204.22s -> 205.32s]  And I can handle that also.
[206.20s -> 207.20s]  I've been handling it, ain't I?
[207.82s -> 208.78s]  I don't know. Have you?
[208.92s -> 211.04s]  Well, I've been up and down these damn hallways
[211.04s -> 213.40s]  in and out of these nut wards for the last 10 years.
[213.44s -> 214.70s]  You think you could follow that act?
[214.80s -> 215.92s]  I'm playing for my life.
[216.10s -> 217.00s]  You're working for money.
[220.24s -> 221.74s]  When you say you're playing for your life,
[221.74s -> 224.26s]  am I to assume that you think that someday you're going to get out of here?
[226.28s -> 227.32s]  Get out of here.
[227.32s -> 231.42s]  Get out of here
[231.42s -> 232.68s]  Where would I go now?
[232.78s -> 234.42s]  What would you do if you got out of here?
[235.20s -> 237.52s]  What if they said to you tomorrow morning, Charles
[237.52s -> 239.10s]  Hey, listen, you're free
[239.10s -> 240.78s]  You can go wherever you want to go
[240.78s -> 241.90s]  Do whatever you want to do
[241.90s -> 242.52s]  What would you do?
[243.20s -> 245.38s]  I'd probably go out front on the grass and sit down
[245.38s -> 247.86s]  The question is
[247.86s -> 250.02s]  Should Manson ever go free?
[250.92s -> 251.96s]  It's ten years now
[251.96s -> 254.16s]  Since he and his three female accomplices
[254.16s -> 267.56s]  Virtually robots under his control were convicted of murder On August the 9th 1969 they murdered actress Sharon Tate and four other people in Los Angeles The following night there were two more victims
[268.02s -> 274.40s]  Lino and Rosemary LaBianca. In court, Manson was also charged with two more mutilation murders.
[275.16s -> 280.14s]  Ranch hand Donald Shea was beheaded, and musician Gary Heineman had his ear cut off.
[280.14s -> 287.14s]  According to some accounts, Manson and his family may have been responsible for as many as 35 killings.
[287.14s -> 291.14s]  If you got out of here, there are a lot of people who think you'd go start killing people again.
[291.14s -> 295.14s]  Again? Well, you guys have misinformed. I haven't killed anyone.
[295.14s -> 301.14s]  I didn't break the law. The judge knew that. But the people didn't want to hear it.
[301.14s -> 306.14s]  The judge knew it. He washed his hands. He said, I know it, but what can I do? People want this.
[306.14s -> 309.14s]  The judge never said that. That's what Alder said.
[309.14s -> 313.94s]  older said no judge didn't say that he got off and shook the hands didn't he you're so white and pure
[313.94s -> 318.94s]  judge didn't say you were innocent are you innocent innocent of what well that's what i'm saying none
[318.94s -> 322.14s]  of us are innocent yeah just because you're convicted in a courtroom doesn't mean you're
[322.14s -> 326.04s]  guilty of something what does mean you're guilty when you know you're guilty what about shay
[326.04s -> 330.80s]  what about him well what about him he got killed well the word is you killed him
[330.80s -> 337.58s]  word is that you're an old woman word is you have turkey in the sky word is i don't know what word
[337.58s -> 342.58s]  did somebody else tell you that i didn't tell you did you kill shay hell no did you cut the human's
[342.58s -> 349.04s]  ear off hell yes why how'd that feel when you cut his ear off uh what did it feel like yeah
[349.04s -> 356.20s]  well i had done what he said for about 20 years i'd done everything he told me to do
[356.20s -> 361.22s]  and i got to thinking now why don't this guy do something i tell him to do
[361.22s -> 367.64s]  and he said no i said well how come i'm always doing what you tell me to do
[367.64s -> 374.88s]  but then you never do what i say do and he said well blah blah blah so i said
[374.88s -> 381.36s]  now you do what i say and he said no i said you do exactly what i say
[381.36s -> 388.78s]  and he said no i'm telling you i'm not asking you i'm telling you you do exactly what i say
[388.78s -> 394.50s]  and that's about the extent of it all this all cult all that hocus pocus stuff that you guys are
[394.50s -> 398.22s]  playing i don't know nothing about all you know nothing about something called helter skelter
[398.22s -> 402.98s]  tell me charles i don't know it's a fairy it's worse than a fairy tale it's a fairy tale
[402.98s -> 408.90s]  it's uh it's it's a comedy it's a comedy tragedy the body of sharon tate is make believe uh that's
[408.90s -> 413.18s]  that's make believe that's make believe to the people that went in there and did what they did
[413.18s -> 417.78s]  and who were those people you know who you know but you know who they were sure know who they were
[417.78s -> 422.78s]  with you at the Spahn Ranch. They were part of this thing called, if not the Manson family or
[422.78s -> 428.44s]  the Manson cult, the Manson Ranch. Call it what you will. So then, what? You dealt the hand down
[428.44s -> 433.80s]  in L.A. You and that press, you dealt the hand. You put me on Life Magazine, had me convicted before
[433.80s -> 438.32s]  I walked in the courtroom. You had what people wanted to buy. And when they wanted to buy it,
[438.40s -> 441.32s]  they didn't give a damn if they had to convict a district attorney. They had to convicted the
[441.32s -> 445.72s]  whole building to get that dollar bill going there. They had big bucks going there. They made
[445.72s -> 447.62s]  $27 million, $1,000, $100 billion.
[447.96s -> 450.20s]  I'm bumming $10, $15 for my friend here.
[450.78s -> 453.44s]  Here's another newspaper account that you can now speak to
[453.44s -> 455.14s]  since you haven't done it before.
[455.62s -> 460.46s]  That on the night following the killings at the house on Cielo Drive in Los Angeles,
[461.30s -> 467.26s]  you accompanied four people to a home occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Leo LaBianca.
[467.74s -> 470.86s]  That you went inside that house and you tied them up
[470.86s -> 473.40s]  and assured them that they were not going to be hurt.
[473.40s -> 477.62s]  that you went back outside and sent Kasabian and Krenwinkel
[477.62s -> 480.88s]  and Watson and Atkins inside the house to kill them.
[481.12s -> 482.52s]  True or false?
[487.10s -> 488.24s]  Did you do that?
[491.84s -> 493.10s]  Chair's getting hot, huh?
[503.40s -> 508.40s]  Did you do that?
[508.40s -> 510.40s]  Did I kill anyone? No.
[510.40s -> 513.40s]  Did you go in and tie up the LaBiancas that night?
[513.40s -> 514.40s]  Very simple question.
[514.40s -> 516.40s]  That night.
[516.40s -> 527.04s]  August 10th 1969 That night August the 10th 1969 Did you Why duck it Why dodge it Why not answer it yes or no once and for all put it behind you
[527.04s -> 532.04s]  Mm-hmm.
[532.04s -> 537.64s]  Did I kill anyone?
[537.64s -> 538.84s]  Did you tie up the LaBiancas?
[538.84s -> 551.46s]  Atkins testified you did
[551.46s -> 555.14s]  That's what Susie said
[555.14s -> 556.00s]  That's what she said
[556.00s -> 557.30s]  And you remember
[557.30s -> 558.82s]  You were in the courtroom when she said it
[558.82s -> 560.76s]  She's written three books
[560.76s -> 562.20s]  And each time she said something different
[562.20s -> 563.38s]  Each time
[563.38s -> 564.62s]  Did you tie them up?
[565.02s -> 565.32s]  Did I?
[565.32s -> 569.22s]  Well, we came down from Abilene.
[572.00s -> 574.78s]  Let's stay in Los Angeles, August 10, 1969.
[575.44s -> 577.32s]  There was a hole-in-the-wall gang there.
[581.02s -> 582.92s]  Why don't you want to talk about it, Charles?
[583.22s -> 587.94s]  Because I'm an outlaw, and I go so far, and then that's all you know.
[592.28s -> 593.86s]  That's like asking Jesse James.
[593.86s -> 602.02s]  And if, as others have written and as others have testified and as the media has reported, you did that.
[602.22s -> 602.54s]  Yeah.
[602.68s -> 605.14s]  And you sent your friends back in to do the deed.
[605.20s -> 605.98s]  Aren't you a coward?
[606.14s -> 608.54s]  My friends back in to do the terrible deed.
[608.78s -> 609.58s]  Doesn't that make you?
[609.68s -> 610.02s]  The wicked deed.
[610.32s -> 619.02s]  Did we have the castle there with the vampires and the Frankenstein and the bugs and lizards dying in the deserts?
[619.54s -> 622.80s]  Did we have the water that's dying and the whales are being killed and the seals are dying?
[622.80s -> 623.48s]  Here we go again.
[623.48s -> 624.88s]  Lay it off on somebody else.
[624.96s -> 626.82s]  Let's point to all the other injustices.
[626.84s -> 628.22s]  I'm in the world all by myself?
[629.62s -> 629.98s]  Yeah.
[630.34s -> 631.52s]  On this one, you are.
[631.76s -> 632.00s]  Yeah.
[632.40s -> 632.76s]  Yeah.
[634.54s -> 637.28s]  It was okay if that's the way you see it for you.
[637.38s -> 640.64s]  You've never talked about this before, but I'm going to try it one more time.
[641.00s -> 642.16s]  Let's pull the cards out.
[642.78s -> 644.04s]  You can see them where I'm finished.
[644.04s -> 644.90s]  You got a pistol on you?
[645.00s -> 645.48s]  No, sir.
[645.66s -> 647.10s]  They wouldn't let me in here if I had a pistol.
[647.20s -> 649.50s]  You know that as well as I do, so why even ask the question?
[649.78s -> 651.98s]  Well, I just thought you might not like what I've done.
[652.04s -> 652.96s]  You want to do something about it.
[653.48s -> 655.48s]  I don't much care for what you've done.
[655.68s -> 655.70s]  Yeah.
[656.60s -> 657.66s]  A lot of people don't.
[657.70s -> 658.54s]  How do you feel about that?
[659.12s -> 660.72s]  A lot of people think you're a monster, Charles.
[660.82s -> 664.20s]  Yeah, they think you're a monster because you reflect this news media on me.
[665.50s -> 666.10s]  Cult leader.
[666.36s -> 668.06s]  I never had long hair before I got busted.
[668.20s -> 669.86s]  I never had a beard before I got busted.
[670.76s -> 673.22s]  I went to shave, and the guy said, no, you can't shave.
[673.60s -> 674.82s]  I said, I need a razor to shave.
[674.86s -> 675.60s]  He said, no, you can't shave.
[675.64s -> 676.30s]  I said, let me get a haircut.
[676.40s -> 677.66s]  He said, no, we don't want you to change your appearance.
[677.84s -> 681.00s]  They said, I had a great family, and I was the following, and leaders, and all that.
[681.00s -> 681.90s]  There was no followers of leaders.
[682.02s -> 683.34s]  There was a bunch of kids out at the ranch playing.
[683.48s -> 692.64s]  to me playing at what playing at living do you miss women certainly my goodness yeah damn right
[692.64s -> 699.96s]  yeah what do you think of women oh i like them yeah they're nice if they're put together well
[699.96s -> 704.74s]  and everything and they're soft and spongy yeah they're nice as long as they keep their mouth
[704.74s -> 709.72s]  shut and do what they're supposed to do why do you say that because that's what a woman's supposed
[709.72s -> 714.14s]  to do keep her mouth shut and do what she's supposed to do sure and besides the son that
[714.14s -> 719.28s]  you had in your marriage you've got what four other children somewhere i don't uh uh think i've
[719.28s -> 725.70s]  been uh uh responsible for as much as you people want to lay on me all right somewhere out there
[725.70s -> 730.26s]  somewhere there's at least one son that we know of that's your child who's probably about 25 or 26
[730.26s -> 735.86s]  years old you talk to that kid what are you gonna say to him you gotta catch it on your own boy
[735.86s -> 738.68s]  trains hard
[738.68s -> 740.28s]  the roads rough
[740.28s -> 742.96s]  and that's it
[742.96s -> 745.16s]  that's all I knew
[745.16s -> 746.82s]  that's all anyone ever told me
[746.82s -> 747.24s]  alright
[747.24s -> 753.72s]  and you want to hear something
[753.72s -> 754.38s]  yeah
[754.38s -> 755.86s]  he'll do it better than me
[755.86s -> 756.78s]  do what
[756.78s -> 758.36s]  whatever he does
[758.36s -> 760.04s]  he'll do it a little better
[760.04s -> 762.10s]  kids do don't they
[762.10s -> 763.24s]  sometimes
[763.24s -> 763.78s]  yeah
[763.78s -> 765.70s]  that's what makes them such a cast
[765.70s -> 767.36s]  They always seem to get through.
[767.36s -> 768.36s]  How were you in school?
[768.36s -> 770.70s]  I hear that you weren't too good, but maybe I heard one.
[770.70s -> 771.70s]  Depends on which school.
[771.70s -> 774.44s]  I did very well in reform school.
[774.44s -> 788.02s]  I did good in every place that I was ever told to do good in I been an outlaw ever since I was born I went to reform school when I was about 10 and I learned to box and cry
[788.50s -> 791.30s]  and I learned to do all the things that you do in reform school.
[792.06s -> 794.94s]  Then I went to, I escaped there a bunch of times,
[795.00s -> 795.82s]  and I went to prison,
[795.94s -> 797.76s]  and I learned everything that you do in prison.
[798.28s -> 801.08s]  And I talked to all the guys and asked them everything they knew,
[801.44s -> 803.14s]  and they told me all the things they knew.
[803.82s -> 805.44s]  And then I went to the end of it,
[805.44s -> 807.80s]  and then the old man would be ready to die,
[807.90s -> 810.58s]  and he'd say, well, son, sincerity is the best gimmick.
[810.64s -> 811.20s]  Remember that.
[811.36s -> 812.40s]  And I'd say, all right, be sincere.
[812.52s -> 813.18s]  That'll win it.
[813.22s -> 813.90s]  He said, that's it.
[814.80s -> 816.38s]  Sincerity and honesty, he said, will do it.
[816.40s -> 817.38s]  It'll trick them every time.
[817.98s -> 819.60s]  I said, well, sincere and honesty.
[819.66s -> 820.76s]  I never tried that.
[821.42s -> 824.52s]  I tried everything else, but maybe I'll try sincere and honesty.
[825.34s -> 827.10s]  So then I looked in the book, and it says,
[827.18s -> 828.50s]  the wages of sin is death.
[829.06s -> 830.96s]  Now I figured, well, I don't want to die,
[830.96s -> 832.86s]  so maybe I have been sinful here.
[833.50s -> 834.48s]  Maybe I am wrong.
[834.48s -> 838.84s]  Maybe I'll take a look at my life and say, well, I'm going to change it and start all over.
[839.72s -> 842.72s]  And I know I go to God and I say, hey, man, you're going to forgive me?
[842.76s -> 843.90s]  And he's going to say, what do you do?
[843.94s -> 844.70s]  You forgive you?
[845.92s -> 847.18s]  I mean, what did you come to me for?
[847.82s -> 848.88s]  Forgive yourself, man.
[848.90s -> 849.74s]  Don't be bothering me.
[849.84s -> 854.42s]  How do you feel about spending the rest of your life in prison?
[855.64s -> 857.70s]  Well, we're all our own prisons.
[857.94s -> 861.02s]  We each are our own wardens and we do our own times.
[861.02s -> 865.30s]  We used to get stuck in our own little trips and we'd kind of judge ourselves the way we do.
[866.62s -> 869.36s]  You know, I can't judge nobody else.
[869.58s -> 872.62s]  The best thing I could do is try to judge myself and live with that.
[873.06s -> 876.30s]  Let's assume that one day you were paroled.
[876.62s -> 879.52s]  Let's just make believe.
[879.60s -> 880.32s]  Do you ever think you will be?
[880.82s -> 882.70s]  Yeah, do I ever think I will be?
[884.34s -> 886.08s]  Well, I've never been paroled before.
[887.02s -> 890.92s]  I went up to the board and they said I was incorrigible.
[891.02s -> 896.08s]  And not only was I incorrigible, but I'd never grow up.
[897.00s -> 898.56s]  And I kind of agreed with him.
[899.18s -> 902.54s]  If you got out tomorrow, do you have any scores to settle on the outside?
[902.76s -> 903.20s]  Scores?
[904.82s -> 906.76s]  Do I have any scores out there?
[907.82s -> 909.02s]  And we're making believe, right?
[909.46s -> 910.74s]  Well, I'll tell you, buddy.
[921.02s -> 928.98s]  Well, I don't rightly know.
[930.68s -> 935.14s]  I'm stupid to the point to where I'm not really sure.
[936.30s -> 939.00s]  Believe it or not, there are a lot of people on the outside
[939.00s -> 942.54s]  that think about the possibility of you coming out of here,
[942.66s -> 944.34s]  and they're genuinely scared of you.
[944.34s -> 947.20s]  Oh, boy, I might just make dust.
[947.90s -> 948.92s]  Everything, terrible.
[949.28s -> 950.60s]  One little guy, terrible.
[950.60s -> 954.40s]  Oh, boy, how insecure are we as human beings?
[954.80s -> 957.76s]  Put all our fear on one little guy, afraid to let him out.
[958.22s -> 959.50s]  He might break all the toys.
[960.64s -> 962.00s]  Why do you say little guy?
[963.98s -> 966.48s]  Because I'm not the guy you're trying to make out of me.
[967.42s -> 968.30s]  That's not me.
[969.06s -> 970.50s]  I don't know what my way is.
[970.56s -> 972.24s]  Everybody keeps telling me I got all these things.
[972.24s -> 974.80s]  I read the other day where I had magical powers,
[974.92s -> 977.50s]  and I told everybody in the chapel, I said, zap, zap, zap, zap.
[977.86s -> 979.36s]  I said, where's my magical powers?
[979.36s -> 982.72s]  I said, well, you can't believe what you read in the press.
[982.92s -> 987.26s]  I can get no magical powers, mystical trips and all that kind of crap.
[990.20s -> 991.56s]  Yeah, it's kind of silly.
[992.92s -> 994.36s]  You know, we've got witches and devils.
[995.60s -> 998.32s]  One guy come up and said, I heard you said you were Jesus.
[999.16s -> 1001.00s]  I said, no, man, I ain't said nothing.
[1001.04s -> 1001.78s]  He said, I'm glad.
[1002.28s -> 1003.40s]  He said, I'm damn glad.
[1003.56s -> 1004.08s]  I said, why?
[1004.54s -> 1005.80s]  He said, I know you ain't here.
[1006.54s -> 1007.40s]  I said, how do you know?
[1007.40s -> 1008.74s]  He said, because I am.
[1009.36s -> 1011.04s]  I said, OK.
[1013.20s -> 1015.64s]  But, I mean, you know, I've been in the net ward for 10 years,
[1015.74s -> 1019.52s]  so you can't expect me to rationally take this thing serious.
[1019.52s -> 1020.82s]  Thank you.
