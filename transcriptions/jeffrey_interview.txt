[0.00s -> 2.12s]  I desensitize myself to it.
[2.12s -> 10.72s]  I, I, I, I don't know, I went to great lengths.
[10.72s -> 14.16s]  He is pure evil, but you'd never know it by looking at him.
[14.16s -> 17.00s]  But when you hear him, that's another story.
[17.00s -> 19.36s]  His killing field was Milwaukee, and he got away
[19.36s -> 21.24s]  with murder for more than a decade.
[21.24s -> 22.80s]  But how could any of this happen?
[22.80s -> 25.48s]  For the first time ever, Nancy Glass is here,
[25.48s -> 27.56s]  inside the world of Jeffrey Dahmer.
[27.56s -> 29.92s]  Bill, when I sat down opposite Jeffrey Dahmer
[29.92s -> 32.92s]  for this interview, I wondered what he would tell me,
[32.92s -> 35.20s]  how hard it would be to get him to discuss
[35.20s -> 36.96s]  his horrific crimes.
[36.96s -> 39.92s]  What I found was that he was very forthcoming.
[39.92s -> 43.20s]  He volunteered details that may be difficult to hear.
[43.20s -> 47.56s]  I began by asking what he wanted from the men he picked up.
[47.56s -> 52.72s]  I had these obsessive desires and thoughts
[52.72s -> 58.92s]  wanting to control them, to, I don't know how
[58.92s -> 62.32s]  to put it, possess them permanently.
[62.32s -> 63.56s]  And that's why you killed them.
[63.56s -> 65.40s]  Right, right.
[65.40s -> 68.68s]  Not because I was angry with them, not because I hated them,
[68.68s -> 73.20s]  but because I wanted to keep them with me.
[73.20s -> 80.84s]  And as my obsession grew, I was saving body parts,
[80.84s -> 85.44s]  such as skulls and skeletons.
[85.44s -> 88.84s]  Jeffrey Dahmer is recalling his monstrous past.
[88.96s -> 93.00s]  Almost two years ago in this little apartment in Milwaukee,
[93.00s -> 95.32s]  police discovered the grisly remnants
[95.32s -> 97.08s]  of one of the most horrible crime
[97.08s -> 99.28s]  sprees in American history.
[99.28s -> 102.88s]  Jeffrey Dahmer, an unassuming chocolate factory worker,
[102.88s -> 106.24s]  would eventually confess that he had seduced, murdered,
[106.24s -> 108.92s]  and dismembered 17 young men.
[108.92s -> 112.96s]  He even ate some of his victims' body parts.
[112.96s -> 116.28s]  He instantly became the center of worldwide media
[116.28s -> 119.40s]  attention, a serial killer unmasked.
[119.40s -> 124.08s]  There were protests and press conferences in Milwaukee
[124.08s -> 127.12s]  as people tried to understand how this could have happened
[127.12s -> 128.48s]  in their midst.
[128.48s -> 131.28s]  How did Jeffrey Dahmer get away with murder
[131.28s -> 133.92s]  after murder for 13 years?
[133.92s -> 137.24s]  How did a boy born into a hardworking middle class
[137.24s -> 141.68s]  family turn into the worst kind of monster imaginable?
[141.68s -> 144.84s]  In this exclusive interview, we put those questions
[144.84s -> 146.96s]  to Jeffrey Dahmer himself.
[146.96s -> 149.48s]  We met with him at the maximum security prison
[149.48s -> 153.40s]  where he is serving his sentence of 999 years.
[153.40s -> 157.12s]  For the first time, he talks about his crimes
[157.12s -> 160.20s]  and gives us a chilling look inside the mind
[160.20s -> 162.64s]  of a serial killer.
[162.64s -> 166.08s]  It's a process that doesn't happen overnight
[166.08s -> 170.32s]  when you depersonalize another person
[170.32s -> 175.20s]  and view them as just an object, an object for pleasure
[175.20s -> 177.80s]  instead of a living, breathing human being.
[180.52s -> 189.36s]  It seems to make it easier to do things you shouldn't do.
[189.36s -> 192.16s]  The reason why Jeffrey Dahmer was able to get away
[192.16s -> 196.32s]  with his crimes was because of just what you are seeing here.
[196.32s -> 199.24s]  Jeffrey Dahmer is intelligent and articulate.
[199.28s -> 201.60s]  That is what makes him so frightening.
[201.60s -> 203.92s]  But if you listen carefully to his words
[203.92s -> 208.88s]  throughout this interview, you realize it is a thin disguise.
[208.88s -> 210.96s]  You do sound, though, like the kind of person
[210.96s -> 214.28s]  who could have said to himself, this is wrong.
[214.28s -> 216.56s]  I must stop.
[216.56s -> 219.48s]  I always knew that it was wrong,
[219.48s -> 229.32s]  but after the first killing was not planned,
[229.32s -> 234.96s]  I was coming back from the shopping mall back in 78.
[234.96s -> 239.76s]  I had fantasies about picking up a hitchhiker
[239.76s -> 242.44s]  and taking him back to the house
[242.44s -> 247.52s]  and having complete control and dominance over him.
[247.56s -> 250.08s]  The hitchhiker's name was Stephen Hicks.
[250.08s -> 251.88s]  He was just 18.
[251.88s -> 254.80s]  Jeffrey Dahmer took him to his parents' house.
[254.80s -> 257.08s]  There, he strangled him with a barbell.
[257.08s -> 260.24s]  He dismembered the body and hid it in a drain pipe.
[260.24s -> 262.92s]  It was Jeffrey Dahmer who gave those details
[262.92s -> 265.80s]  to the police in his confession.
[265.80s -> 269.40s]  No one had a clue as to what was happening
[269.40s -> 271.36s]  for over a decade.
[271.36s -> 274.08s]  During that time, Jeffrey Dahmer joined the army
[274.08s -> 275.68s]  and was sent to Germany.
[275.68s -> 278.52s]  He was eventually discharged for a drinking problem
[278.52s -> 280.44s]  and returned to Ohio.
[280.44s -> 283.04s]  Nine years after Stephen Hicks' murder,
[283.04s -> 284.80s]  the killing began again.
[284.80s -> 287.84s]  What happened to you in the nine years in between
[287.84s -> 290.16s]  that you were able to stop?
[290.16s -> 292.40s]  That you were able to control yourself?
[292.40s -> 297.24s]  Just wasn't an opportunity to fully express
[297.24s -> 299.52s]  what I wanted to do.
[299.52s -> 301.52s]  There was just not the physical opportunity
[301.52s -> 303.32s]  to do it then.
[303.32s -> 310.68s]  And I started, when I moved to Milwaukee in 81,
[310.68s -> 314.52s]  I started reading pornography, going to the bookstores.
[317.96s -> 324.00s]  Eventually, that led to frequenting the gay bars.
[324.00s -> 329.48s]  And then one time, I brought this young man back
[329.48s -> 333.00s]  to the hotel room, the Ambassador Hotel.
[333.04s -> 335.16s]  I was just planning on drugging him
[335.16s -> 337.92s]  and spending the night with him.
[337.92s -> 339.76s]  I had no intention of hurting him.
[339.76s -> 344.24s]  When I woke up in the morning, he had a broken rib here.
[344.24s -> 346.16s]  I was heavily bruised.
[346.16s -> 350.28s]  Apparently, I had beaten him to death with my fists.
[350.28s -> 351.32s]  And you have no memory of it?
[351.32s -> 352.56s]  No memory of it.
[352.56s -> 355.80s]  But that's what started the whole spree all over again.
[355.80s -> 358.52s]  Dahmer says he snuck the corpse of his victim,
[358.52s -> 361.96s]  Stephen Toomey, out of his hotel room in a suitcase.
[361.96s -> 364.36s]  Then he took it to his grandmother's house,
[364.36s -> 368.24s]  where he cut up the body and put it in plastic garbage bags.
[368.24s -> 373.32s]  When you killed these men afterwards, were you repulsed?
[373.32s -> 374.76s]  Were you upset?
[374.76s -> 380.36s]  No, at the time, it was almost addictive.
[380.36s -> 386.80s]  It was almost a surge of energy.
[386.80s -> 394.36s]  I wouldn't have to worry about any of their needs or anything.
[394.36s -> 397.12s]  I just had complete control of the situation.
[397.12s -> 399.24s]  But Jeffrey Dahmer was out of control.
[399.24s -> 401.60s]  The urge to kill had overpowered him.
[401.60s -> 404.20s]  As police later learned, he wasn't satisfied
[404.20s -> 405.72s]  with his victim's death.
[405.72s -> 407.04s]  He wanted more.
[407.04s -> 409.60s]  Why did you photograph them?
[409.60s -> 415.08s]  It was my way of remembering their appearance,
[415.08s -> 416.16s]  their physical beauty.
[419.08s -> 423.24s]  I also wanted to keep something.
[423.24s -> 426.20s]  If I couldn't keep them there with me whole,
[426.20s -> 431.52s]  at least I felt that I could keep their skeletons.
[431.52s -> 436.16s]  And I even went so far as planning on setting up
[436.16s -> 442.24s]  an altar with the 10 different skulls and skeletons.
[442.24s -> 444.96s]  And what was the purpose of the altar going to be?
[445.96s -> 456.32s]  It was a sort of memorial, a point where I could, I don't know.
[456.32s -> 458.48s]  It's so bizarre and strange.
[458.48s -> 460.00s]  It's hard to describe.
[460.00s -> 464.40s]  A place where I could collect my thoughts
[464.40s -> 466.40s]  and feed my obsession.
[466.40s -> 471.08s]  When the bodies were still in your apartment,
[471.08s -> 475.76s]  there was no time when you would see them and say,
[475.76s -> 477.36s]  this is grotesque.
[477.36s -> 479.16s]  What have I done?
[479.16s -> 480.36s]  There were times.
[480.36s -> 481.20s]  There were times.
[481.20s -> 487.56s]  But the compulsive obsession with doing what I was doing
[487.56s -> 490.32s]  overpowered any feelings of revulsion.
[490.32s -> 493.00s]  This man with a quiet, almost shy demeanor
[493.00s -> 495.92s]  became a master manipulator who was able to lure
[495.92s -> 499.04s]  strangers he met at gay bars to his apartment.
[499.04s -> 501.00s]  He was even able to con the police
[501.00s -> 503.96s]  into returning a 14-year-old boy to him
[503.96s -> 507.60s]  after neighbors called 911 upset that the child was
[507.60s -> 509.80s]  in the street naked and bleeding.
[509.80s -> 512.32s]  Dahmer convinced the police that he and the boy
[512.32s -> 514.76s]  were simply having a lover's quarrel.
[514.76s -> 520.76s]  This is the intoxicated boyfriend of another boyfriend.
[520.76s -> 522.32s]  How was this child?
[522.32s -> 523.96s]  It wasn't a child, it was an adult.
[523.96s -> 527.12s]  After the police left, Jeffrey Dahmer murdered that boy.
[527.16s -> 529.40s]  Conorak sent the some phone.
[529.40s -> 532.72s]  This man says he had a near-fatal encounter
[532.72s -> 534.08s]  with Jeffrey Dahmer.
[534.08s -> 536.20s]  He wanted to take some picture of my back.
[536.20s -> 539.52s]  He hit me with a rubber hammer on my neck.
[539.52s -> 541.96s]  He was lucky to escape because by then,
[541.96s -> 544.68s]  the killing had become almost routine.
[544.68s -> 547.68s]  Before you went out to pick up a man,
[547.68s -> 550.48s]  was there any kind of ritual you went through?
[550.48s -> 553.76s]  I go to the nightclubs, drink,
[553.76s -> 558.56s]  watch the striptease shows.
[558.56s -> 561.80s]  And if I didn't meet anyone at the bars,
[561.80s -> 567.40s]  I'd go to the bathclubs and meet someone there,
[567.40s -> 573.48s]  offer them money, and we'd go back to the apartment,
[573.48s -> 574.56s]  have a few drinks.
[574.56s -> 581.60s]  I'd have the sleeping pill mixture already prepared.
[581.60s -> 584.76s]  A person would drink it, fall asleep,
[584.76s -> 589.20s]  and that's when they would be strangled.
[589.20s -> 593.20s]  Watching the movie, Exorcist 3, was also part of his ritual.
[593.20s -> 595.44s]  It put him in the mood for murder.
[595.44s -> 600.84s]  I felt so hopelessly evil and perverted
[600.84s -> 608.88s]  that I actually derived a sort of pleasure
[608.88s -> 610.44s]  from watching that tape.
[610.44s -> 612.24s]  Did you like feeling evil?
[612.24s -> 614.16s]  No, no I didn't.
[614.16s -> 619.24s]  But I tried to overcome the thoughts
[619.24s -> 623.60s]  and it worked for a while, but eventually I gave in.
[623.60s -> 626.08s]  While Jeffrey Dahmer may say things today
[626.08s -> 628.20s]  that make it seem like he understands
[628.20s -> 631.40s]  what went on in his mind, he does not.
[631.40s -> 633.68s]  All he can do is tell you what happened,
[633.68s -> 637.28s]  but he cannot stop whatever it is that drove him
[637.28s -> 639.48s]  to kill in the first place.
[639.48s -> 642.32s]  Do you still feel those same urges?
[642.32s -> 646.04s]  Do you still feel that compulsion, that obsession?
[646.04s -> 649.96s]  I wish I could say that it just left completely,
[649.96s -> 654.32s]  but no, there are times when I still
[654.32s -> 656.76s]  do have the old compulsions.
[656.76s -> 658.68s]  Jeffrey Dahmer says as time went on,
[658.68s -> 660.80s]  his mind became more and more warped,
[660.80s -> 664.32s]  and yet he was clever enough to continue to elude police
[664.32s -> 666.84s]  and lure young men to his apartment.
[666.88s -> 670.32s]  We should warn you the details are very graphic.
[670.32s -> 673.44s]  I started having these obsessive thoughts
[673.44s -> 678.60s]  when I was about 15 and 16, and they got worse and worse.
[678.60s -> 682.40s]  What were your fantasies about?
[682.40s -> 686.28s]  They were sexual fantasies of control, power,
[686.28s -> 688.32s]  complete dominance.
[688.32s -> 689.76s]  They became reality.
[689.76s -> 692.00s]  Was there pleasure in that fantasy?
[692.00s -> 697.68s]  There was excitement, fear, pleasure, all mixed together.
[697.68s -> 700.04s]  Jeffrey Dahmer fulfilled his fantasies
[700.04s -> 703.64s]  by murdering and dismembering 17 young men.
[703.64s -> 706.84s]  In time, his desires became more extreme,
[706.84s -> 709.04s]  his deeds more grotesque.
[709.04s -> 712.20s]  Listen to him talk about the most unnatural things
[712.20s -> 714.84s]  in the most matter of fact of ways.
[714.84s -> 718.20s]  That's when you realize that none of it has touched him.
[718.20s -> 720.28s]  I was branching out.
[720.28s -> 724.76s]  That's when the cannibalism started, eating of the heart
[724.76s -> 727.88s]  and the arm muscle.
[727.88s -> 735.60s]  It was a way of making me feel that they were a part of me.
[735.60s -> 740.16s]  First it was just curiosity, and then it became compulsive.
[740.16s -> 744.88s]  Then I tried to keep the person alive
[744.88s -> 747.92s]  by inducing a zombie-like state.
[751.28s -> 759.28s]  By injecting first dilute acid solution into their brain
[759.28s -> 765.28s]  or hot water, and it never did completely work.
[765.28s -> 767.28s]  Could someone like you be stopped?
[767.28s -> 769.28s]  Could you be helped?
[769.28s -> 776.28s]  No, I was dead set on going with this compulsion.
[776.28s -> 782.28s]  It was the only thing that gave me any satisfaction.
[782.28s -> 785.28s]  He became so warped by his evil impulses
[785.28s -> 788.28s]  that he even took a victim's head with him
[788.28s -> 791.28s]  to work at the Ambrosia Chocolate Factory.
[791.28s -> 798.28s]  I kept the mummified head and skull of one of the victims
[798.28s -> 802.28s]  in a carrying case in my locker at work.
[802.28s -> 804.28s]  Were you almost flaunting it?
[804.28s -> 807.28s]  Yes, but that's how strong the compulsion was.
[807.28s -> 810.28s]  That's how bizarre the desire was.
[810.28s -> 814.28s]  I wanted to keep something of the person with me.
[814.28s -> 818.28s]  Jeffrey Dahmer exhibited some disturbing behavior early on.
[818.28s -> 821.28s]  He began drinking heavily as a teenager,
[821.28s -> 822.28s]  dropped out of college,
[822.28s -> 826.28s]  was arrested for indecent exposure, disorderly conduct
[826.28s -> 828.28s]  and fondling a 13-year-old boy.
[828.28s -> 833.28s]  Tragically, one of his murder victims would be that boy's brother.
[833.28s -> 834.28s]  Do you know what started it?
[834.28s -> 837.28s]  Was there any kind of incident that you can remember?
[837.28s -> 839.28s]  To this day, I don't know what started it.
[839.28s -> 843.28s]  And the person to blame is sitting right across from you.
[843.28s -> 845.28s]  That's the only person.
[845.28s -> 849.28s]  Not parents, not society, not pornography.
[849.28s -> 851.28s]  I mean, those are just excuses.
[851.28s -> 854.28s]  His macabre 13-year crime spree finally ended
[854.28s -> 856.28s]  when this man, Tracy Edwards,
[856.28s -> 859.28s]  brought the police to the infamous apartment
[859.28s -> 862.28s]  like the others he had gone there with the promise of money.
[862.28s -> 864.28s]  He was listening to my heart because at a point,
[864.28s -> 866.28s]  he told me he was going to eat my heart at that point.
[866.28s -> 868.28s]  I hit him and I ran.
[868.28s -> 870.28s]  What was the turning point for you
[870.28s -> 872.28s]  that made you suddenly realize
[872.28s -> 874.28s]  that you had done something terribly wrong,
[874.28s -> 876.28s]  something you should be sorry for?
[876.28s -> 879.28s]  It was the night of the arrest.
[879.28s -> 885.28s]  They have no memory of what happened during the six hours
[885.28s -> 889.28s]  before the last victim ran out of the apartment.
[889.28s -> 891.28s]  I heard a knock on the door,
[891.28s -> 898.28s]  and the police were there with the last victim.
[898.28s -> 902.28s]  They asked me where the key was to the handcuffs.
[902.28s -> 905.28s]  My mind was in a haze.
[905.28s -> 907.28s]  I sort of pointed to the bedroom,
[907.28s -> 910.28s]  and that's where they found the pictures.
[910.28s -> 912.28s]  And they yelled, cuff them.
[912.28s -> 915.28s]  I was handcuffed.
[915.28s -> 918.28s]  And it was just the realization
[918.28s -> 926.28s]  that there was no point in trying to hide my actions anymore.
[926.28s -> 932.28s]  The best route was to help the police identify all the victims
[932.28s -> 935.28s]  and just make a complete confession.
[935.28s -> 937.28s]  When it was revealed that most of the victims
[937.28s -> 939.28s]  were black or homosexual,
[939.28s -> 941.28s]  people in Milwaukee were incensed.
[941.28s -> 944.28s]  Many felt that was why he went after them
[944.28s -> 946.28s]  and why the police didn't seem to care
[946.28s -> 949.28s]  when their families reported them missing.
[949.28s -> 952.28s]  10 of your 17 victims were black.
[952.28s -> 954.28s]  Were they racially motivated?
[954.28s -> 956.28s]  It was not racially motivated.
[956.28s -> 958.28s]  It was not sexual preference.
[958.28s -> 961.28s]  It was just to find an obsession
[961.28s -> 965.28s]  with the best-looking young man I could find.
[965.28s -> 967.28s]  While you just heard him say
[967.28s -> 970.28s]  that his sexual preference had nothing to do with the killings,
[970.28s -> 973.28s]  he has not come to terms with his homosexuality.
[973.28s -> 975.28s]  Never understood it.
[975.28s -> 977.28s]  There was no use trying to fight it
[977.28s -> 979.28s]  because I couldn't rid myself of it.
[979.28s -> 981.28s]  It was too powerful and persistent.
[981.28s -> 983.28s]  Do you dislike it?
[983.28s -> 987.28s]  Yes, it's caused a lot of problems for me.
[987.28s -> 991.28s]  A lot of conflicts and unanswered questions.
[991.28s -> 993.28s]  The conflicts remain with him
[993.28s -> 995.28s]  and so do his compulsions.
[995.28s -> 999.28s]  But in prison, he finally cannot act on his savage desires.
[999.28s -> 1002.28s]  If you were out on the street now,
[1002.28s -> 1004.28s]  would you still be committing the crimes?
[1004.28s -> 1007.28s]  Probably. If this hadn't happened, there's no doubt.
[1007.28s -> 1009.28s]  I probably would be.
[1009.28s -> 1012.28s]  I can't think of anything that would have stopped me.
