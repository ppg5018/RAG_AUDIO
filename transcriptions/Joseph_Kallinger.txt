[0.00s -> 8.00s]  There are killers on the loose. Traveling from town to town, state to state, stalking their
[8.00s -> 12.00s]  victims, kidnapping, raping, then murdering them.
[12.00s -> 14.00s]  What would you do if you got out of here?
[14.00s -> 16.00s]  I would probably do the same thing all over again.
[16.00s -> 18.00s]  What would you do?
[18.00s -> 20.00s]  Try to murder everyone on the planet earth.
[20.00s -> 26.00s]  Joseph Kellinger, a brutal serial killer. We'll be seeing more of him tonight too.
[26.00s -> 32.00s]  On average, each day, five innocent people fall victim to homicidal monsters, like John Wayne Gacy,
[32.00s -> 35.00s]  who is convicted of more murders than anyone else.
[35.00s -> 39.00s]  Authorities have identified 120 serial sex killers.
[39.00s -> 43.00s]  According to some estimates, 35 of them are still on the loose.
[43.00s -> 49.00s]  They roam the highways and shopping centers of America, crazed with sadistic lust.
[49.00s -> 52.00s]  Police insist that to avoid becoming one of their victims,
[52.00s -> 57.00s]  the public must first understand the perverse kind of twisted minds that they are up against.
[57.00s -> 62.00s]  So meet Joe Kellinger, currently serving a life sentence for sex-related murder
[62.00s -> 67.00s]  here at the state hospital for the criminally insane just outside Scranton, Pennsylvania.
[67.00s -> 74.00s]  I'm a patient person, got a good listing here and try to help people.
[74.00s -> 78.00s]  You're a patient with a good ear and you try to help people?
[78.00s -> 79.00s]  Yes.
[79.00s -> 80.00s]  When you're not trying to murder them?
[80.00s -> 81.00s]  Yes.
[81.00s -> 87.00s]  When Kellinger's reign of terror ended, three were dead, including his 14-year-old son.
[87.00s -> 89.00s]  You murdered your own son?
[89.00s -> 90.00s]  Yes, I did.
[90.00s -> 92.00s]  Why did you do that?
[92.00s -> 97.00s]  He was a sacrifice. I was to murder 3 million people on planet Earth,
[97.00s -> 102.00s]  and he was a sacrifice to see if I could murder one of my own.
[102.00s -> 108.00s]  At the end of murdering all the people on Earth, I was going to murder my own family
[108.00s -> 110.00s]  and then take my own life and become God.
[110.00s -> 112.00s]  What do you think of the death penalty?
[112.00s -> 114.00s]  I'm opposed to it.
[114.00s -> 117.00s]  The state has no right to take your life, but you can murder other people?
[117.00s -> 119.00s]  I don't think anyone has the right to take your life.
[119.00s -> 121.00s]  Except you?
[121.00s -> 123.00s]  When I'm under hallucination, I do.
[123.00s -> 127.00s]  These voices from God, these hallucinations, do you still experience them?
[127.00s -> 129.00s]  Yes, I do.
[129.00s -> 130.00s]  Often?
[130.00s -> 132.00s]  Often.
[132.00s -> 134.00s]  Do you ever feel violent?
[134.00s -> 135.00s]  Yes, I do.
[135.00s -> 136.00s]  What do you feel like doing?
[136.00s -> 137.00s]  Killing people.
[137.00s -> 139.00s]  You still feel like killing people?
[139.00s -> 140.00s]  Yes.
[140.00s -> 142.00s]  Describe the feeling that you get when you feel like killing people?
[142.00s -> 151.00s]  Well, last March 11th, I was hallucinating and I took a razor blade and I cut a man's throat.
[151.00s -> 152.00s]  Here in the hospital?
[152.00s -> 153.00s]  Here in the hospital.
[153.00s -> 155.00s]  Do you think it murdered me, Joe?
[155.00s -> 156.00s]  Yes.
[156.00s -> 158.00s]  That's gruesome, Joe.
[158.00s -> 159.00s]  That's horrible.
[159.00s -> 160.00s]  Yes, it is.
[160.00s -> 163.00s]  And you don't blame me if I say I hope you never get out of this place.
[163.00s -> 166.00s]  I hope I never do either.
[166.00s -> 168.00s]  Amen.
[169.00s -> 172.00s]  Brrr, brrr, brrr.
